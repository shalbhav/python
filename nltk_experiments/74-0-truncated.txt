forty years

While Tom was eating his and stealing sugar as opportunity
Aunt Polly asked him questions that were full of and

The new boy stepped over and

The new boy took two broad coppers out of his pocket and held them out

streak added to the her astonishment was almost She

She was so overcome by the splendor of his achievement that she took
him into the closet and selected a choice apple and delivered it to
along with an improving lecture upon the added value and flavor a treat

And while she closed with a happy Scriptural he ôhookedö a


Then he skipped and saw Sid just starting up the outside stairway

black thread and getting him into

Tom skirted the and came round into a muddy alley that led by the
back of his auntÆs He presently got safely beyond the reach
of capture and and hastened toward the public square of the

she had gone out of his heart like a casual stranger whose visit is


He worshipped this new angel with furtive till he saw that she had

began to ôshow offö in all sorts of absurd boyish in order to win

her way toward the Tom came up to the fence and leaned on

moment on the steps and then moved toward the Tom heaved a great
sigh as she put her foot on the But his face lit

The boy ran around and stopped within a foot or two of the and
then shaded his eyes with his hand and began to look down street as
if he had discovered something of interest going on in that
Presently he picked up a straw and began trying to balance it on his

so brimful of exultation that he could hardly hold himself when the old
lady came back and stood above the wreck discharging lightnings of wrath

ôHold what æer you belting _me_ broke

Aunt Polly and Tom looked for healing But when
she got her tongue she only

other audacious mischief when I wasnÆt like enough.ö

Then her conscience reproached and she yearned to say something
kind and but she judged that this would be construed into a
confession that she had been in the and discipline forbade
So she kept and went about her affairs with a troubled
Tom sulked in a corner and exalted his He knew that in her heart
his aunt was on her knees to and he was morosely gratified by the
consciousness of He would hang out no he would take notice
of He knew that a yearning glance fell upon now and
through a film of but he refused recognition of He pictured
himself lying sick unto death and his aunt bending over him beseeching
one little forgiving but he would turn his face to the and
die with that word how would she feel And he pictured
himself brought home from the with his curls all and
his sore heart at How she would throw herself upon and how
her tears would fall like and her lips pray God to give her back
her boy and she would never abuse him any But he would
lie there cold and white and make no poor little whose
griefs were at an He so worked upon his feelings with the pathos of
these that he had to keep he was so like to
and his eyes swam in a blur of which overflowed when he
and ran down and trickled from the end of his And such a luxury to
him was this petting of his that he could not bear to have any
worldly cheeriness or any grating delight intrude upon it was too
sacred for such and when his cousin Mary danced
all alive with the joy of seeing home again after an age-long visit
of one week to the he got up and moved in clouds and darkness
out at one door as she brought song and sunshine in at the

He wandered far from the accustomed haunts of and sought desolate
places that were in harmony with his A log raft in the river

the dreary vastness of the the that he could
only be all at once and without undergoing the
uncomfortable routine devised by Then he thought of his
He got it rumpled and and it mightily increased his dismal
He wondered if she would pity him if she Would she
and wish that she had a right to put her arms around his neck and
comfort Or would she turn coldly away like all the hollow
This picture brought such an agony of pleasurable suffering that he
worked it over and over again in his mind and set it up in new and
varied till he wore it At last he rose up sighing
and departed in the

About half-past nine or ten oÆclock he came along the deserted street to
where the Adored Unknown he paused a no sound fell upon
his listening a candle was casting a dull glow upon the curtain
of a second-story Was the sacred presence He climbed the

down on the ground under disposing himself upon his with his
hands clasped upon his breast and holding his poor wilted

thus _she_ would see him when she looked out upon the glad and

CHAPTER IV

THE sun rose upon a tranquil and beamed down upon the peaceful
village like a Breakfast Aunt Polly had family
it began with a prayer built from the ground up of solid
courses of Scriptural welded together with a thin mortar of

the Mosaic as from

his verses.ö Sid had learned his lesson days Tom bent all his
energies to the memorizing of five and he chose part of the
Sermon on the because he could find no verses that were

and his hands were busy with distracting Mary took
his book to hear him and he tried to find his way through the

ôAll What is tell me what it is.ö

ôNever you You know if I say itÆs it is nice.ö

ôYou bet you thatÆs All IÆll tackle it again.ö

And he did ôtackle it under the double pressure of curiosity
and prospective gain he did it with such spirit that he accomplished a
shining Mary gave him a brand-new ôBarlowö knife worth twelve
and a half and the convulsion of delight that swept his system
shook him to his the knife would not cut
but it was a ôsure-enoughö and there was inconceivable grandeur
in where the Western boys ever got the idea that such a
weapon could possibly be counterfeited to its injury is an imposing
mystery and will always remain Tom contrived to scarify the
cupboard with and was arranging to begin on the when he was
called off to dress for

Mary gave him a tin basin of water and a piece of and he went
outside the door and set the basin on a little bench then he
dipped the soap in the water and laid it turned up his
poured out the water on the and then entered the kitchen
and began to wipe his face diligently on the towel behind the But
Mary removed the towel and

ôNow ainÆt you You mustnÆt be so Water wonÆt hurt

Tom was a trifle The basin was and this time he
stood over it a little gathering took in a big breath
and When he entered the kitchen with both eyes shut
and groping for the towel with his an honorable testimony of
suds and water was dripping from his But when he emerged from
the he was not yet for the clean territory stopped
short at his chin and his like a below and beyond this line
there was a dark expanse of unirrigated soil that spread downward in
front and backward around his Mary took him in and when she
was done with him he was a man and a without distinction of

wrought into a dainty and symmetrical general privately
smoothed out the with labor and and plastered his
hair close down to his for he held curls to be and his
own filled his life with Then Mary got out a suit of his
clothing that had been used only on Sundays during two were
simply called his ôother so by that we know the size of his
The girl ôput him to rightsö after he had dressed
she buttoned his neat roundabout up to his turned his vast shirt

his speckled straw He now looked exceedingly improved and
He was fully as uncomfortable as he for there

hoped that Mary would forget his but the hope was she
coated them thoroughly with as was the and brought
them He lost his temper and said he was always being made to do
everything he didnÆt want to But Mary

a good boy.ö

So he got into the shoes Mary was soon and the three
children set out for place that Tom hated with his whole
but Sid and Mary were fond of

Sabbath-school hours were from nine to half-past and then church
Two of the children always remained for the sermon
and the other always remained stronger The churchÆs
uncushioned pews would seat about three hundred
the edifice was but a plain with a sort of pine board

and accosted a Sunday-dressed

Tom They were and the property changed
Then Tom traded a couple of white alleys for three red and some
small trifle or other for a couple of blue He waylaid other
boys as they and went on buying tickets of various colors ten
or fifteen minutes He entered the with a swarm
of clean and noisy boys and proceeded to his seat and started
a quarrel with the first boy that came The a
elderly then turned his back a moment and Tom pulled a
boyÆs hair in the next and was absorbed in his book when the boy
turned stuck a pin in another in order to hear
him say and got a new reprimand from his TomÆs whole
class were of a and When they came
to recite their not one of them knew his verses but
had to be prompted all they worried and each
got his small blue each with a passage of Scripture
on each blue ticket was pay for two verses of the Ten
blue tickets equalled a red and could be exchanged for ten red
tickets equalled a yellow for ten yellow tickets the superintendent
gave a very plainly bound Bible forty cents in those easy
to the How many of my readers would have the industry and
application to memorize two thousand even for a Dore And
yet Mary had acquired two Bibles in this was the patient work of
two a boy of German parentage had won four or He once
recited three thousand verses without but the strain upon his
mental faculties was too and he was little better than an idiot
from that day grievous misfortune for the for on great
before the superintendent Tom expressed
had always made this boy come out and ôspread himself.ö Only the older
pupils managed to keep their tickets and stick to their tedious work
long enough to get a and so the delivery of one of these prizes
was a rare and noteworthy the successful pupil was so
great and conspicuous for that day that on the spot every scholarÆs
heart was fired with a fresh ambition that often lasted a couple
of It is possible that TomÆs mental stomach had never really
hungered for one of those but unquestionably his entire being
had for many a day longed for the glory and the eclat that came with

In due course the superintendent stood up in front of the with
a closed hymn-book in his hand and his forefinger inserted between its

makes his customary little a hymn-book in the hand is as
necessary as is the inevitable sheet of music in the hand of a singer

is ever referred to by the This superintendent was a slim
creature of with a sandy goatee and short sandy he
wore a stiff standing-collar whose upper edge almost reached his ears
and whose sharp points curved forward abreast the corners of his
fence that compelled a straight lookout and a turning of the
whole body when a side view was his chin was propped on a
spreading cravat which was as broad and as long as a and had
fringed his boot toes were turned sharply in the fashion
of the like effect patiently and laboriously
produced by the young men by sitting with their toes pressed against a
wall for hours Mr. Walters was very earnest of and very
sincere and honest at and he held sacred things and places
in such and so separated them from worldly that
unconsciously to himself his Sunday-school voice had acquired a peculiar
intonation which was wholly absent on He began after this


I want you all to sit up just as straight and pretty as
you can and give me all your attention for a minute or
is That is the way good little boys and girls should I see one
little girl who is looking out of the am afraid she thinks I
am out there up in one of the trees making a speech
to the little I want to tell you how good it
makes me feel to see so many clean little faces assembled in a
place like learning to do right and be good.ö And so forth and so
It is not necessary to set down the rest of the It was of a
pattern which does not and so it is familiar to us

The latter third of the speech was marred by the resumption of fights
and other recreations among certain of the bad and by fidgetings
and whisperings that extended far and washing even to the bases of
isolated and incorruptible rocks like Sid and But now every sound
ceased with the subsidence of Mr. WaltersÆ and the
conclusion of the speech was received with a burst of silent

A good part of the whispering had been occasioned by an event which was
more or less entrance of lawyer accompanied
by a very feeble and aged a middle-aged gentleman
with iron-gray and a dignified lady who was doubtless the latterÆs
The lady was leading a Tom had been restless and full of
chafings and could not meet Amy
LawrenceÆs he could not brook her loving But when he saw this
small newcomer his soul was all ablaze with bliss in a The next
moment he was ôshowing offö with all his pulling
making a using every art that seemed likely to
fascinate a girl and win her His exaltation had but one
memory of his humiliation in this angelÆs that
record in sand was fast washing under the waves of happiness that
were sweeping over it

The visitors were given the highest seat of and as soon as Mr.
WaltersÆ speech was he introduced them to the The
middle-aged man turned out to be a prodigious less a one
than the county the most august creation these children
had ever looked they wondered what kind of material he was made
they half wanted to hear him and were half afraid he
He was from twelve miles he had
and seen the very eyes had looked upon the county
was said to have a tin The awe which these
reflections inspired was attested by the impressive silence and the
ranks of staring This was the great Judge brother of
their own Jeff Thatcher immediately went to be familiar
with the great man and be envied by the It would have been music
to his soul to hear the

ôLook at HeÆs a going up heÆs a going to
shake hands with _is_ shaking hands with By donÆt you
wish you was

Mr. Walters fell to ôshowing with all sorts of official bustlings
and giving delivering discharging
directions everywhere that he could find a The
librarian ôshowed hither and thither with his arms full of
books and making a deal of the splutter and fuss that insect authority
delights The young lady teachers ôshowed sweetly over
pupils that were lately being lifting pretty warning fingers
at bad little boys and patting good ones The young gentlemen
teachers ôshowed offö with small scoldings and other little displays of
authority and fine attention to most of the of
both found business up at the by the and it was
business that frequently had to be done over again two or three times
much seeming The little girls ôshowed offö in various
and the little boys ôshowed offö with such diligence that the air
was thick with paper wads and the murmur of And above it
all the great man sat and beamed a majestic judicial smile upon all
the and warmed himself in the sun of his own he was
ôshowing

There was only one thing wanting to make Mr. WaltersÆ ecstasy
and that was a chance to deliver a Bible-prize and exhibit a
Several pupils had a few yellow but none had had been
around among the star pupils He would have given
to have that German lad back again with a sound

And now at this when hope was Tom Sawyer came forward with
nine yellow nine red and ten blue and demanded
a This was a thunderbolt out of a clear Walters was not
expecting an application from this source for the next ten But
there was no getting around were the certified and they
were good for their Tom was therefore elevated to a place with
the Judge and the other and the great news was announced from
It was the most stunning surprise of the and
so profound was the sensation that it lifted the new hero up to the
judicial oneÆs and the school had two marvels to gaze upon
in place of The boys were all eaten up with those that
suffered the bitterest pangs were those who perceived too late that they
themselves had contributed to this hated splendor by trading tickets to
Tom for the wealth he had amassed in selling whitewashing
These despised as being the dupes of a wily a
guileful snake in the

The prize was delivered to Tom with as much effusion as the
superintendent could pump up under the but it lacked
somewhat of the true for the poor fellowÆs instinct taught him
that there was a mystery here that could not well bear the
it was simply preposterous that this boy had warehoused two

Amy Lawrence was proud and and she tried to make Tom see it in

next a dim suspicion came and she
a furtive glance told her then her heart and she was

of all

Tom was introduced to the but his tongue was his breath

greatness of the but mainly because he was her He would
have liked to fall down and worship if it were in the The

CHAPTER V

ABOUT half-past ten the cracked bell of the small church began to
and presently the people began to gather for the morning The
Sunday-school children distributed themselves about the house and
occupied pews with their so as to be under Aunt
Polly and Tom and Sid and Mary sat with being placed next
the in order that he might be as far away from the open window
and the seductive outside summer scenes as The crowd filed up

the most lavish in the matter of festivities that St. Petersburg could

a troop of lawn-clad and ribbon-decked young then all
the young clerks in town in a they had stood in the vestibule
sucking their a circling wall of oiled and simpering
till the last girl had run their and last of all came
the Model Willie taking as heedful care of his mother as
if she were cut He always brought his mother to and was
the pride of all the The boys all hated he was so
And he had been ôthrown up to themö so His
white handkerchief was hanging out of his pocket as usual on
Tom had no and he looked upon boys
who had as

The congregation being fully the bell rang once
to warn laggards and and then a solemn hush fell upon the
church which was only broken by the tittering and whispering of the
choir in the The choir always tittered and whispered all
through There was once a church choir that was not
but I have forgotten where it It was a great many years
and I can scarcely remember anything about but I think it was in
some foreign

The minister gave out the and read it through with a in a
peculiar style which was much admired in that part of the His
voice began on a medium key and climbed steadily up till it reached a
certain where it bore with strong emphasis upon the topmost word
and then plunged down as if from a

He was regarded as a wonderful At church ôsociablesö he was
always called upon to read and when he was the ladies
would lift up their hands and let them fall helplessly in their
and ôwallö their and shake their as much as to ôWords
express it is too TOO beautiful for this mortal
earth.ö

After the hymn had been the Mr. Sprague turned himself into
a and read off ônoticesö of meetings and societies and
things till it seemed that the list would stretch out to the crack of
queer custom which is still kept up in even in
away here in this age of abundant the less there is
to justify a traditional the harder it is to get rid of

And now the minister A generous prayer it and went
into it pleaded for the and the little children of the
for the other churches of the for the village
for the for the for the State for the United
for the churches of the United for for the
for the officers of the for poor tossed
by stormy for the oppressed millions groaning under the heel of
European monarchies and Oriental for such as have the light
and the good and yet have not eyes to see nor ears to hear
for the heathen in the far islands of the and closed with
a supplication that the words he was about to speak might find grace
and and be as seed sown in fertile yielding in time a
grateful harvest of

There was a rustling of and the standing congregation sat
The boy whose history this book relates did not enjoy the he
only endured he even did that He was restive all through
he kept tally of the details of the he was not
but he knew the ground of and the clergymanÆs regular
route over when a little trifle of new matter was
his ear detected it and his whole nature resented he considered
additions and In the midst of the prayer a fly had
lit on the back of the pew in front of him and tortured his spirit by
calmly rubbing its hands embracing its head with its and
polishing it so vigorously that it seemed to almost part company with
the and the slender thread of a neck was exposed to scraping
its wings with its hind legs and smoothing them to its body as if they
had been going through its whole toilet as tranquilly as if
it knew it was perfectly As indeed it for as sorely as TomÆs
hands itched to grab for it they did not believed his soul would
be instantly destroyed if he did such a thing while the prayer was going
But with the closing sentence his hand began to curve and steal
and the instant the ôAmenö was out the fly was a prisoner of
His aunt detected the act and made him let it

The minister gave out his text and droned along monotonously through an
argument that was so prosy that many a head by and by began to
yet it was an argument that dealt in limitless fire and brimstone and
thinned the predestined elect down to a company so small as to be hardly
worth the Tom counted the pages of the after church he
always knew how many pages there had but he seldom knew anything
else about the this time he was really interested
for a little The minister made a grand and moving picture of the
assembling together of the worldÆs hosts at the millennium when the lion
and the lamb should lie down together and a little child should lead
But the the the moral of the great spectacle
were lost upon the he only thought of the conspicuousness of the
principal character before the on-looking his face lit with the
and he said to himself that he wished he could be that
if it was a tame

Now he lapsed into suffering as the dry argument was
Presently he bethought him of a treasure he had and got it It was
a large black beetle with formidable he called It
was in a percussion-cap The first thing the beetle did was to
take him by the A natural fillip the beetle went
floundering into the aisle and lit on its and the hurt finger went
into the boyÆs The beetle lay there working its helpless
unable to turn Tom eyed and longed for but it was safe out
of his Other people uninterested in the sermon found relief in
the and they eyed it Presently a vagrant poodle dog came
idling sad at lazy with the summer softness and the
weary of sighing for He spied the the
drooping tail lifted and He surveyed the walked around
smelt at it from a safe walked around it grew
and took a closer then lifted his lip and made a gingerly
snatch at just missing made and began to enjoy
the subsided to his stomach with the beetle between his

and His head and little by little his chin
descended and touched the who seized There was a sharp
a flirt of the poodleÆs and the beetle fell a couple of yards
and lit on its back once The neighboring spectators
shook with a gentle inward several faces went behind fans and
and Tom was entirely The dog looked
and probably felt but there was resentment in his and a
craving for So he went to the beetle and began a wary attack on
it jumping at it from every point of a lighting with his
fore-paws within an inch of the making even closer snatches at
it with his and jerking his head till his ears flapped But
he grew tired once after a tried to amuse himself with a
fly but found no followed an ant with his nose close
to the and quickly wearied of forgot the
beetle and sat down on Then there was a wild yelp of agony
and the poodle went sailing up the the yelps and so
did the he crossed the house in front of the he flew
down the other he crossed before the he clamored up the
his anguish grew with his till presently he was
but a woolly comet moving in its orbit with the gleam and the speed of
At last the frantic sufferer sheered from its and sprang
into its masterÆs he flung it out of the and the voice of
distress quickly thinned away and died in the

By this time the whole church was red-faced and suffocating with
suppressed and the sermon had come to a dead
The discourse was resumed but it went lame and all
possibility of impressiveness being at an for even the gravest
sentiments were constantly being received with a smothered burst of
unholy under cover of some remote as if the poor parson
had said a rarely facetious It was a genuine relief to the whole
congregation when the ordeal was over and the benediction

Tom Sawyer went home quite thinking to himself that there was
some satisfaction about divine service when there was a bit of variety
in He had but one marring he was willing that the dog
should play with his but he did not think it was upright in
him to carry it




CHAPTER VI

MONDAY morning found Tom Sawyer Monday morning always found
him it began another weekÆs slow suffering in He
generally began that day with wishing he had had no intervening
it made the going into captivity and fetters again so much more

Tom lay Presently it occurred to him that he wished he was
then he could stay home from Here was a vague
He canvassed his No ailment was and he investigated
This time he thought he could detect colicky and he
began to encourage them with considerable But they soon grew
and presently died wholly He reflected Suddenly
he discovered One of his upper front teeth was This
was he was about to begin to as a as he
called when it occurred to him that if he came into court with that
his aunt would pull it and that would So he thought
he would hold the tooth in reserve for the and seek
Nothing offered for some little and then he remembered hearing
the doctor tell about a certain thing that laid up a patient for two or
three weeks and threatened to make him lose a So the boy eagerly
drew his sore toe from under the sheet and held it up for
But now he did not know the necessary it seemed
well worth while to chance so he fell to groaning with considerable


But Sid slept on

Tom groaned and fancied that he began to feel pain in the

No result from

Tom was panting with his exertions by this He took a rest and then
swelled himself up and fetched a succession of admirable

Sid snored

Tom was He and shook This course
worked and Tom began to groan Sid then
brought himself up on his elbow with a and began to stare at
Tom went on Sid

What is the
And he shook him and looked in his face

Tom moaned

ItÆll be over by and DonÆt call anybody.ö

ôBut I _DonÆt_ groan itÆs How long you been this

crawl to hear what is the

ôI forgive you Everything youÆve ever done to
When IÆm

ôI forgive Tell æem And you give
my window-sash and my cat with one eye to that new girl thatÆs come to
and tell

But Sid had snatched his clothes and Tom was suffering in
so handsomely was his imagination and so his groans had
gathered quite a genuine

Sid flew downstairs and

Aunt TomÆs

I donÆt believe

But she fled with Sid and Mary at her
And her face grew and her lip When she reached the
bedside she gasped

ôWhatÆs the matter with is the matter with

The old lady sank down into a chair and laughed a then cried a
then did both This restored her and she

what a turn you did give Now you shut up that nonsense and
climb out of this.ö

The groans ceased and the pain vanished from the The boy felt a
little and he

ôAunt it _seemed_ and it hurt so I never minded my
tooth at all.ö

ôYour WhatÆs the matter with your

you donÆt So all this row was because you thought youÆd
get to stay home from school and go I love you
and you seem to try every way you can to break my old heart with your
outrageousness.ö By this time the dental instruments were The old
lady made one end of the silk thread fast to TomÆs tooth with a loop
and tied the other to the Then she seized the chunk of fire and
suddenly thrust it almost into the boyÆs The tooth hung dangling
by the

But all trials bring their As Tom wended to school after
he was the envy of every boy he met because the gap in his
upper row of teeth enabled him to expectorate in a new and admirable
He gathered quite a following of lads interested in the
and one that had cut his finger and had been a centre of fascination and
homage up to this now found himself suddenly without an
and shorn of his His heart was and he said with a disdain
which he did not feel that it wasnÆt anything to spit like Tom
but another boy ôSour and he wandered away a dismantled


Shortly Tom came upon the juvenile pariah of the Huckleberry
son of the town Huckleberry was cordially hated and
dreaded by all the mothers of the because he was idle and lawless
and vulgar and because all their children admired him and
delighted in his forbidden and wished they dared to be like
Tom was like the rest of the respectable in that he envied
Huckleberry his gaudy outcast and was under strict orders
not to play with So he played with him every time he got a
Huckleberry was always dressed in the cast-off clothes of full-grown
and they were in perennial bloom and fluttering with His hat
was a vast ruin with a wide crescent lopped out of its his

had to hide her griefs and still her broken heart and take up the cross

her to exchange sorrows

TOM dodged hither and thither through lanes until he was well out of the
track of returning and then fell into a moody He crossed

TomÆs whole structure of faith was shaken to its He had
many a time heard of this thing succeeding but never of its failing
It did not occur to him that he had tried it several times
but could never find the hiding-places He
puzzled over the matter some and finally decided that some witch
had interfered and broken the He thought he would satisfy himself
on that so he searched around till he found a small sandy spot
with a little funnel-shaped depression in He laid himself down and
put his mouth close to this depression and

He well knew the futility of trying to contend against so he
gave up But it occurred to him that he might as well have

patient search for But he could not find Now he went back to his

CHAPTER X

THE two boys flew on and toward the speechless with
They glanced backward over their shoulders from time to
as if they feared they might be Every stump
that started up in their path seemed a man and an and made them
catch their and as they sped by some outlying cottages that lay
near the the barking of the aroused watch-dogs seemed to give
wings to their

ôIf we can only get to the old tannery before we break whispered
in short catches between ôI canÆt stand it much longer.ö

HuckleberryÆs hard pantings were his only and the boys fixed
their eyes on the goal of their hopes and bent to their work to win
They gained steadily on and at breast to they burst
through the open door and fell grateful and exhausted in the sheltering
shadows By and by their pulses slowed and Tom

what do you reckonÆll come of

ôIf Doctor Robinson I reckon hangingÆll come of it.ö

ôDo you

I _know_ Tom.ö

Tom thought a then he

ôWhoÆll

ôWhat are you talking SÆpose something happened and Injun Joe
_didnÆt_ heÆd kill us some time or just as dead sure
as weÆre a laying here.ö

ôThatÆs just what I was thinking to Huck.ö

ôIf anybody let Muff Potter do if heÆs fool HeÆs
generally drunk enough.ö

Tom said on Presently he

Muff Potter donÆt know How can he

ôWhatÆs the reason he donÆt know

ôBecause heÆd just got that whack when Injun Joe done DÆyou reckon
he could see DÆyou reckon he knowed

ôBy thatÆs

ôAnd that whack done for

ætaint He had liquor in I could see and
he always when papÆs you might take and belt
him over the head with a church and you couldnÆt phase He says
his own So itÆs the same with Muff of But if a man
was dead I reckon maybe that whack might fetch I dono.ö

After another reflective Tom

you sure you can keep

we _got_ to keep You know That Injun devil wouldnÆt
make any more of drownding us than a couple of if we was to squeak
æbout this and they didnÆt hang less take
and swear to one what we got to to keep mum.ö

ôIÆm ItÆs the best Would you just hold hands and swear
that

ôOh that wouldnÆt do for ThatÆs good enough for little
rubbishy common with cuz _they_ go back on you
and blab if they get in a there orter be writing æbout
a big thing like And blood.ö

TomÆs whole being applauded this It was and and
the the the were in keeping with
He picked up a clean pine shingle that lay in the took a
little fragment of ôred keelö out of his got the moon on
his and painfully scrawled these emphasizing each slow
down-stroke by clamping his tongue between his and letting up the
pressure on the next

ôHuck Finn and Tom Sawyer swears they will keep mum about This and They
wish They may Drop down dead in Their Tracks if They ever Tell and Rot.ö

Huckleberry was filled with admiration of TomÆs facility in and
the sublimity of his He at once took a pin from his lapel and
was going to prick his but Tom

ôHold DonÆt do A pinÆs It might have verdigrease on
it.ö

ôWhatÆs

ôItÆs ThatÆs what it You just swaller some of it
see.ö

So Tom unwound the thread from one of his and each boy pricked
the ball of his thumb and squeezed out a drop of In after
many Tom managed to sign his using the ball of his
little finger for a Then he showed Huckleberry how to make an H and
an and the oath was They buried the shingle close to the
with some dismal ceremonies and and the fetters
that bound their tongues were considered to be locked and the key thrown


A figure crept stealthily through a break in the other end of the ruined

ôOf course it It donÆt make any difference _what_ we got
to keep WeÆd drop down _you_ know

I reckon thatÆs so.ö

They continued to whisper for some little Presently a dog set up
a lugubrious howl just ten feet of The boys
clasped each other in an agony of

ôWhich of us does he gasped

ôI through the



ôI canÆt _do_

There ætis

IÆm whispered ôI know his ItÆs Bull

If Mr. Harbison owned a slave named Tom would have spoken of
him as ôHarbisonÆs but a son or a dog of that name was ôBull

The dog howled The boysÆ hearts sank once

whisper was hardly audible when he

I reckon weÆre I reckon there ainÆt no mistake æbout

ôDad fetch This comes of playing hookey and doing everything a

I lay IÆll just _waller_ in And Tom began to snuffle a


ô_You_ and Huckleberry began to snuffle ôConsound Tom

Tom choked off and

HeÆs got his _back_ to

_Now_ who can he

The howling Tom pricked up his

WhatÆs he

ôSounds hogs somebody Tom.ö

ôThat _is_ Where æbouts is

ôI bleeve itÆs down at ætother Sounds Pap used to sleep
ælong with the but laws bless he just lifts

The spirit of adventure rose in the boysÆ souls once

do you dasÆt to go if I

ôI donÆt like sÆpose itÆs Injun

Tom But presently the temptation rose up strong again and the
boys agreed to with the understanding that they would take to their
heels if the snoring So they went tiptoeing stealthily
the one behind the When they had got to within five steps of the
Tom stepped on a and it broke with a sharp The man
writhed a and his face came into the It was
Muff The boysÆ hearts had stood and their hopes
when the man but their fears passed away They tip-toed
through the broken and stopped at a little distance
to exchange a parting That lugubrious howl rose on the night
air They turned and saw the strange dog standing within a few
feet of where Potter was and _facing_ with his nose
pointing

itÆs exclaimed both in a

say a stray dog come howling around Johnny MillerÆs
æbout as much as two weeks and a whippoorwill come
in and lit on the banisters and the very same and there

I know And suppose there DidnÆt Gracie Miller fall
in the kitchen fire and burn herself terrible the very next

but she ainÆt And whatÆs sheÆs getting too.ö

ôAll you wait and SheÆs a just as dead sure as Muff
PotterÆs a ThatÆs what the niggers and they know all about
these kind of Huck.ö

Then they When Tom crept in at his bedroom window
the night was almost He undressed with excessive and
fell asleep congratulating himself that nobody knew of his He
was not aware that the gently-snoring Sid was and had been so for
an

When Tom Sid was dressed and There was a late look in the
a late sense in the He was Why had he not
been till he was as The thought filled
him with Within five minutes he was dressed and
feeling sore and The family were still at but they had
finished There was no voice of but there were averted
there was a silence and an air of solemnity that struck a chill
to the culpritÆs He sat down and tried to seem but it
was up-hill it roused no no and he lapsed into
silence and let his heart sink down to the

After breakfast his aunt took him and Tom almost brightened in
the hope that he was going to be but it was not His aunt
wept over him and asked him how he could go and break her old heart
and finally told him to go and ruin himself and bring her gray hairs
with sorrow to the for it was no use for her to try any
This was worse than a thousand and TomÆs heart was sorer now
than his He he pleaded for promised to reform
over and over and then received his feeling that
he had won but an imperfect forgiveness and established but a feeble


He left the presence too miserable to even feel revengeful toward
and so the latterÆs prompt retreat through the back gate was
He moped to school gloomy and and took his
along with Joe for playing hookey the day with the
air of one whose heart was busy with heavier woes and wholly dead to
Then he betook himself to his rested his elbows on his
desk and his jaws in his and stared at the wall with the stony
stare of suffering that has reached the limit and can no further
His elbow was pressing against some hard After a long time
he slowly and sadly changed his and took up this object with
a It was in a He unrolled A colossal
sigh and his heart It was his brass andiron

This final feather broke the camelÆs




CHAPTER XI

CLOSE upon the hour of noon the whole village was suddenly electrified
with the ghastly No need of the as yet un-dreamed-of
the tale flew from man to from group to from house to
with little less than telegraphic Of course the schoolmaster gave
holi-day for that the town would have thought strangely of
him if he had

A gory knife had been found close to the murdered and it had been
recognized by somebody as belonging to Muff the story And
it was said that a belated citizen had come upon Potter washing himself
in the ôbranchö about one or two oÆclock in the and that Potter
had at once sneaked especially the washing
which was not a habit with It was also said that the town had
been ransacked for this ômurdererö public are not slow in the
matter of sifting evidence and arriving at a but that he
could not be Horsemen had departed down all the roads in every
and the Sheriff ôwas confidentö that he would be captured
before

All the town was drifting toward the TomÆs heartbreak
vanished and he joined the not because he would not
a thousand times rather go anywhere but because an
unaccountable fascination drew him Arrived at the dreadful he
wormed his small body through the crowd and saw the dismal
It seemed to him an age since he was there Somebody pinched
his He and his eyes met Then both looked
elsewhere at and wondered if anybody had noticed anything in their
mutual But everybody was and intent upon the grisly
spectacle before

ôPoor ôPoor young ôThis ought to be a lesson to grave
ôMuff PotterÆll hang for this if they catch This was the
drift of and the minister ôIt was a His hand is
here.ö

Now Tom shivered from head to for his eye fell upon the stolid
face of Injun At this moment the crowd began to sway and
and voices ôItÆs itÆs heÆs coming

from twenty

ôMuff

heÆs heÆs DonÆt let him get

People in the branches of the trees over TomÆs head said he wasnÆt
trying to get only looked doubtful and

ôInfernal said a ôwanted to come and take a quiet
look at his I expect any company.ö

The crowd fell and the Sheriff came ostentatiously
leading Potter by the The poor fellowÆs face was and
his eyes showed the fear that was upon When he stood before the
murdered he shook as with a and he put his face in his hands
and burst into

ôI didnÆt do he ôæpon my word and honor I never
done it.ö

ôWhoÆs accused shouted a

This shot seemed to carry Potter lifted his face and looked around
him with a pathetic hopelessness in his He saw Injun and


Injun you promised me youÆd

ôIs that your and it was thrust before him by the

Potter would have fallen if they had not caught him and eased him to the
Then he

ôSomething told me æt if I didnÆt come back and He then
waved his nerveless hand with a vanquished gesture and ôTell
tell ainÆt any use any more.ö

Then Huckleberry and Tom stood dumb and and heard the
stony-hearted liar reel off his serene they expecting every
moment that the clear sky would deliver GodÆs lightnings upon his
and wondering to see how long the stroke was And when he had
finished and still stood alive and their wavering impulse to
break their oath and save the poor betrayed prisonerÆs life faded and
vanished for plainly this miscreant had sold himself to Satan and
it would be fatal to meddle with the property of such a power as

ôWhy didnÆt you What did you want to come here somebody


ôI couldnÆt help couldnÆt help Potter ôI wanted to
run but I couldnÆt seem to come anywhere but here.ö And he fell to
sobbing

Injun Joe repeated his just as a few minutes
afterward on the under and the seeing that the
lightnings were still were confirmed in their belief that
Joe had sold himself to the He was now to the most
balefully interesting object they had ever looked and they could
not take their fascinated eyes from his

They inwardly resolved to watch him when opportunity should
in the hope of getting a glimpse of his dread

Injun Joe helped to raise the body of the murdered man and put it in
a wagon for and it was whispered through the shuddering
crowd that the wound bled a The boys thought that this happy
circumstance would turn suspicion in the right but they were
for more than one villager

ôIt was within three feet of Muff Potter when it done it.ö

TomÆs fearful secret and gnawing conscience disturbed his sleep for as
much as a week after and at breakfast one morning Sid

you pitch around and talk in your sleep so much that you keep me
awake half the time.ö

Tom blanched and dropped his

ôItÆs a bad said Aunt ôWhat you got on your


Nothing æt I know of.ö But the boyÆs hand shook so that he
spilled his

ôAnd you do talk such Sid ôLast night you æItÆs
itÆs thatÆs what it You said that over and
And you æDonÆt torment me Tell What is it
youÆll

Everything was swimming before There is no telling what might have
but luckily the concern passed out of Aunt PollyÆs face
and she came to TomÆs relief without knowing She

ItÆs that dreadful I dream about it most every night
Sometimes I dream itÆs me that done it.ö

Mary said she had been affected much the same Sid seemed
Tom got out of the presence as quick as he plausibly and after
that he complained of toothache for a and tied up his jaws every
He never knew that Sid lay nightly and frequently
slipped the bandage free and then leaned on his elbow listening a good
while at a and afterward slipped the bandage back to its place
TomÆs distress of mind wore off gradually and the toothache grew
irksome and was If Sid really managed to make anything out of
TomÆs disjointed he kept it to

It seemed to Tom that his schoolmates never would get done holding
inquests on dead and thus keeping his trouble present to his
Sid noticed that Tom never was coroner at one of these
though it had been his habit to take the lead in all new
he that Tom never acted as a that was
and Sid did not overlook the fact that Tom even showed a marked aversion
to these and always avoided them when he Sid
but said even inquests went out of vogue at and
ceased to torture TomÆs

Every day or during this time of Tom watched his
opportunity and went to the little grated jail-window and smuggled such
small comforts through to the ômurdererö as he could get hold The
jail was a trifling little brick den that stood in a marsh at the edge
of the and no guards were afforded for it
was seldom These offerings greatly helped to ease TomÆs


The villagers had a strong desire to tar-and-feather Injun Joe and ride
him on a for but so formidable was his character
that nobody could be found who was willing to take the lead in the
so it was He had been careful to begin both of his
inquest-statements with the without confessing the grave-robbery
that preceded therefore it was deemed wisest not to try the case in
the courts at




CHAPTER XII

ONE of the reasons why TomÆs mind had drifted away from its secret
troubles that it had found a new and weighty matter to interest
itself Becky Thatcher had stopped coming to Tom had
struggled with his pride a few and tried to ôwhistle her down the
but He began to find himself hanging around her fatherÆs
and feeling very She was ill. What if she
should There was distraction in the He no longer took an
interest in nor even in The charm of life was there
was nothing but dreariness He put his hoop and his
there was no joy in them any His aunt was She began to
try all manner of remedies on She was one of those people who
are infatuated with patent medicines and all new-fangled methods of
producing health or mending She was an inveterate experimenter in
these When something fresh in this line came out she was in a
right to try not on for she was never
but on anybody else that came She was a subscriber for all the
ôHealthö periodicals and phrenological and the solemn ignorance
they were inflated with was breath to her All the ôrotö they
contained about and how to go to and how to get
and what to and what to and how much exercise to and
what frame of mind to keep oneÆs self and what sort of clothing
to was all gospel to and she never observed that her
health-journals of the current month customarily upset everything they
had recommended the month She was as simple-hearted and honest
as the day was and so she was an easy She gathered
together her quack periodicals and her quack and thus armed
with went about on her pale metaphorically with
ôhell following after.ö But she never suspected that she was not an
angel of healing and the balm of Gilead in to the suffering


The water treatment was and TomÆs low condition was a windfall
to She had him out at daylight every stood him up in the
wood-shed and drowned him with a deluge of cold then she scrubbed
him down with a towel like a and so brought him then she
rolled him up in a wet sheet and put him away under blankets till she
sweated his soul clean and ôthe yellow stains of it came through his
Tom

Yet notwithstanding all the boy grew more and more melancholy and
pale and She added hot sitz shower and
The boy remained as dismal as a She began to assist the
water with a slim oatmeal diet and She calculated his
capacity as she would a and filled him up every day with quack


Tom had become indifferent to persecution by this This phase
filled the old ladyÆs heart with This indifference must
be broken up at any Now she heard of Pain-killer for the first
She ordered a lot at She tasted it and was filled with
It was simply fire in a liquid She dropped the water
treatment and everything and pinned her faith to
She gave Tom a teaspoonful and watched with the deepest anxiety for the
Her troubles were instantly at her soul at peace
for the ôindifferenceö was broken The boy could not have shown a
heartier if she had built a fire under

Tom felt that it was time to wake this sort of life might be
romantic in his blighted but it was getting to have
too little sentiment and too much distracting variety about So he
thought over various plans for and finally hit upon that of
professing to be fond of He asked for it so often that he
became a and his aunt ended by telling him to help himself and
quit bothering If it had been she would have had no misgivings
to alloy her but since it was she watched the bottle
She found that the medicine did really but it
did not occur to her that the boy was mending the health of a crack in
the sitting-room floor with

One day Tom was in the act of dosing the crack when his auntÆs yellow
cat came eyeing the teaspoon and begging
for a Tom

ôDonÆt ask for it unless you want Peter.ö

But Peter signified that he did want

ôYou better make sure.ö

Peter was

ôNow youÆve asked for and IÆll give it to because there ainÆt
anything mean about but if you find you donÆt like you mustnÆt
blame anybody but your own self.ö

Peter was So Tom pried his mouth open and poured down
the Peter sprang a couple of yards in the and then
delivered a war-whoop and set off round and round the banging
against upsetting and making general Next
he rose on his hind feet and pranced in a frenzy of
with his head over his shoulder and his voice proclaiming his
unappeasable Then he went tearing around the house again
spreading chaos and destruction in his Aunt Polly entered in time
to see him throw a few double deliver a final mighty

with The old lady stood petrified with peering over
her Tom lay on the floor expiring with

what on earth ails that

ôI donÆt gasped the

I never see anything like What did make him act

ôDeed I donÆt Aunt cats always act so when theyÆre having a
good time.ö

ôThey do There was something in the tone that made Tom


That I believe they do.ö

ôYou

ôYesÆm.ö

The old lady was bending Tom with interest emphasized
by Too late he divined her ôdrift.ö The handle of the telltale
tea-spoon was visible under the Aunt Polly took held it
Tom and dropped his Aunt Polly raised him by the usual
cracked his head soundly with her

what did you want to treat that poor dumb beast

ôI done it out of pity for he hadnÆt any aunt.ö

ôHadnÆt any What has that got to do with

Because if heÆd had one sheÆd a burnt him out SheÆd a
roasted his bowels out of him æthout any more feeling than if he was a


Aunt Polly felt a sudden pang of This was putting the thing in
a new what was cruelty to a cat _might_ be cruelty to a
She began to she felt Her eyes watered a and she
put her hand on TomÆs head and said

ôI was meaning for the it _did_ do you good.ö

Tom looked up in her face with just a perceptible twinkle peeping
through his

ôI know you was meaning for the and so was I with It
done _him_ I never see him get around so

go ælong with before you aggravate me And you try
and see if you canÆt be a good for and you neednÆt take any

Tom reached school ahead of It was noticed that this strange thing
had been occurring every day And as usual of
he hung about the gate of the schoolyard instead of playing with his

be looking everywhere but whither he really was the

CHAPTER XIII

TOMÆS mind was made up He was gloomy and He was a
friendless he nobody loved when they found out
what they had driven him perhaps they would be he had tried
to do right and get but they would not let since nothing
would do them but to be rid of let it be and let them blame
_him_ for the shouldnÆt What right had the
friendless to they had forced him to it at he would
lead a life of There was no

By this time he was far down Meadow and the bell for school to
ôtake upö tinkled faintly upon his He to think he
should never hear that old familiar sound any was very
but it was forced on since he was driven out into the cold
he must he forgave Then the sobs came thick and


Just at this point he met his soulÆs sworn Joe
and with evidently a great and dismal purpose in his
Plainly here were ôtwo souls with but a single thought.ö
wiping his eyes with his began to blubber out something about
a resolution to escape from hard usage and lack of sympathy at home by
roaming abroad into the great world never to and ended by hoping
that Joe would not forget

But it transpired that this was a request which Joe had just been going
to make of and had come to hunt him up for that His mother
had whipped him for drinking some cream which he had never tasted and
knew nothing it was plain that she was tired of him and wished
him to if she felt that there was nothing for him to do but
he hoped she would be and never regret having driven her
poor boy out into the unfeeling world to suffer and

As the two boys walked sorrowing they made a new compact to stand
by each other and be brothers and never separate till death relieved
them of their Then they began to lay their Joe was for
being a and living on crusts in a remote and
some of cold and want and but after listening to he
conceded that there were some conspicuous advantages about a life of

afternoon was they had all managed to enjoy the sweet glory of
spreading the fact that pretty soon the town would ôhear something.ö All
who got this vague hint were cautioned to ôbe mum and wait.ö

About midnight Tom arrived with a boiled ham and a few

ôHuck Finn the and Joe Harper the Terror of the Seas.ö Tom
had furnished these from his favorite

ôæTis Give the countersign.ö

Two hoarse whispers delivered the same awful word simultaneously to the
brooding



Then Tom tumbled his ham over the bluff and let himself down after
tearing both skin and clothes to some extent in the There was
an comfortable path along the shore under the but it lacked
the advantages of difficulty and danger so valued by a

The Terror of the Seas had brought a side of and had about worn
himself out with getting it Finn the Red-Handed had stolen a
skillet and a quantity of half-cured leaf and had also brought
a few corn-cobs to make pipes But none of the pirates smoked or
ôchewedö but The Black Avenger of the Spanish Main said it
would never do to start without some That was a wise
matches were hardly known there in that They saw a fire smouldering
upon a great raft a hundred yards and they went stealthily
thither and helped themselves to a They made an imposing
adventure of every now and and suddenly
halting with finger on moving with hands on imaginary

well enough that the raftsmen were all down at the village laying
in stores or having a but still that was no excuse for their
conducting this thing in an unpiratical

They shoved Tom in Huck at the after oar and

they all looked so long that they came near letting the current drift
them out of the range of the But they discovered the danger in

raft grounded on the bar two hundred yards above the head of the

of the little raftÆs belongings consisted of an old and this they
spread over a nook in the bushes for a tent to shelter their

They built a fire against the side of a great log twenty or thirty steps
within the sombre depths of the and then cooked some bacon in
the frying-pan for and used up half of the corn ôponeö stock

The climbing fire lit up their faces and threw its ruddy
glare upon the pillared tree-trunks of their forest and upon the
varnished foliage and festooning

When the last crisp slice of bacon was and the last allowance

CHAPTER XIV

WHEN Tom awoke in the he wondered where he He sat up and
rubbed his eyes and looked Then he It was the cool
gray and there was a delicious sense of repose and peace in the
deep pervading calm and silence of the Not a leaf not
a sound obtruded upon great NatureÆs Beaded dewdrops stood
upon the leaves and A white layer of ashes covered the
and a thin blue breath of smoke rose straight into the Joe and Huck
still

far away in the woods a bird another presently
the hammering of a woodpecker was Gradually the cool dim gray
of the morning and as gradually sounds multiplied and life
manifested The marvel of Nature shaking off sleep and going
to work unfolded itself to the musing A little green worm came
crawling over a dewy lifting two-thirds of his body into the air
from time to time and ôsniffing then proceeding he
was Tom and when the worm approached of its own
he sat as still as a with his hopes rising and
by as the creature still came toward him or seemed inclined to
go and when at last it considered a painful moment with its
curved body in the air and then came decisively down upon TomÆs leg and
began a journey over his whole heart was that meant that
he was going to have a new suit of the shadow of a
doubt a gaudy piratical Now a procession of ants
from nowhere in and went about their one struggled
manfully by with a dead spider five times as big as itself in its

the dizzy height of a grass and Tom bent down close to it and

credulous about and he had practised upon its simplicity
more than A tumblebug came heaving sturdily at its and
Tom touched the to see it shut its legs against its body
and pretend to be The birds were fairly rioting by this A
the Northern lit in a tree over TomÆs and trilled
out her imitations of her neighbors in a rapture of then
a shrill jay swept a flash of blue and stopped on a twig

strangers with a consuming a gray squirrel and a big fellow
of the ôfoxö kind came skurrying sitting up at intervals to
inspect and chatter at the for the wild things had probably never
seen a human being before and scarcely knew whether to be afraid or
All Nature was wide awake and long lances of sunlight
pierced down through the dense foliage far and and a few
butterflies came fluttering upon the

Tom stirred up the other pirates and they all clattered away with
a and in a minute or two were stripped and chasing after and
tumbling over each other in the shallow limpid water of the white
They felt no longing for the little village sleeping in the
distance beyond the majestic waste of A vagrant current or a
slight rise in the river had carried off their but this only
gratified since its going was something like burning the bridge
between them and

They came back to camp wonderfully and
and they soon had the camp-fire blazing up Huck found a
spring of clear cold water close and the boys made cups of broad oak
or hickory and felt that sweetened with such a wildwood
charm as would be a good enough substitute for While Joe
was slicing bacon for Tom and Huck asked him to hold on a
they stepped to a promising nook in the river-bank and threw in
their almost immediately they had Joe had not had time
to get impatient before they were back again with some handsome
a couple of sun-perch and a small enough for quite a
They fried the fish with the and were for
no fish had ever seemed so delicious They did not know that the
quicker a fresh-water fish is on the fire after he is caught the better
he and they reflected little upon what a sauce open-air
open-air and a large ingredient of hunger

They lay around in the after while Huck had a
and then went off through the woods on an exploring They
tramped gayly over decaying through tangled
among solemn monarchs of the hung from their crowns to the
ground with a drooping regalia of Now and then they came
upon snug nooks carpeted with grass and jeweled with

They found plenty of things to be delighted but nothing to be
astonished They discovered that the island was about three miles
long and a quarter of a mile and that the shore it lay closest to
was only separated from it by a narrow channel hardly two hundred yards
They took a swim about every so it was close upon the middle
of the afternoon when they got back to They were too hungry to
stop to but they fared sumptuously upon cold and then threw
themselves down in the shade to But the talk soon began to
and then The the solemnity that brooded in the
and the sense of began to tell upon the spirits of the
They fell to A sort of undefined longing crept upon This
took dim was budding Even Finn the
Red-Handed was dreaming of his doorsteps and empty But they
were all ashamed of their and none was brave enough to speak
his

For some the boys had been dully conscious of a peculiar
sound in the just as one sometimes is of the ticking of a
clock which he takes no distinct note But now this mysterious sound
became more and forced a The boys
glanced at each and then each assumed a listening There
was a long profound and then a sullen boom came
floating down out of the

ôWhat is exclaimed under his

ôI said Tom in a

ôæTainÆt said in an awed ôbecuz

said talk.ö

They waited a time that seemed an and then the same muffled boom
troubled the solemn

ôLetÆs go and see.ö

They sprang to their feet and hurried to the shore toward the They
parted the bushes on the bank and peered out over the The little
steam ferry-boat was about a mile below the drifting with the
Her broad deck seemed crowded with There were a great
many skiffs rowing about or floating with the stream in the neighborhood
of the but the boys could not determine what the men in
them were Presently a great jet of white smoke burst from the
ferryboatÆs and as it expanded and rose in a lazy that same
dull throb of sound was borne to the listeners

ôI know exclaimed ôsomebodyÆs

ôThatÆs said ôthey done that last when Bill Turner
got they shoot a cannon over the and that makes
him come up to the and they take loaves of bread and put
quicksilver in æem and set æem and wherever thereÆs anybody
thatÆs theyÆll float right there and stop.ö

IÆve heard about said ôI wonder what makes the bread
do that.ö

it ainÆt the so said ôI reckon itÆs mostly what
they _say_ over it before they start it out.ö

ôBut they donÆt say anything over said ôIÆve seen æem and
they donÆt.ö

thatÆs said ôBut maybe they say it to Of
_course_ they Anybody might know that.ö

The other boys agreed that there was reason in what Tom because
an ignorant lump of uninstructed by an could not
be expected to act very intelligently when set upon an errand of such


ôBy I wish I was over said

ôI do tooö said Huck ôIÆd give heaps to know who it is.ö

The boys still listened and Presently a revealing thought
flashed through TomÆs and he

I know whoÆs

They felt like heroes in an Here was a gorgeous they
were they were hearts were breaking on their
tears were being accusing memories of unkindness to these poor
lost lads were rising and unavailing regrets and remorse were being
and best of the departed were the talk of the whole
and the envy of all the as far as this dazzling notoriety was
This was It was worth while to be a after

As twilight drew the ferryboat went back to her accustomed business
and the skiffs The pirates returned to They were
jubilant with vanity over their new grandeur and the illustrious trouble
they were They caught cooked supper and ate and then
fell to guessing at what the village was thinking and saying about
and the pictures they drew of the public distress on their account were
gratifying to look their point of But when the shadows
of night closed them they gradually ceased to and sat gazing
into the with their minds evidently wandering The
excitement was and Tom and Joe could not keep back thoughts
of certain persons at home who were not enjoying this fine frolic as
much as they Misgivings they grew troubled and a
sigh or two By and by Joe timidly ventured upon a
roundabout ôfeelerö as to how the others might look upon a return to
right

Tom withered him with being uncommitted as joined
in with and the waverer quickly and was glad to get
out of the scrape with as little taint of chicken-hearted home-sickness
clinging to his garments as he Mutiny was effectually laid to
rest for the

As the night Huck began to and presently to
Joe followed Tom lay upon his elbow for some
watching the two At last he got up on his
and went searching among the grass and the flickering reflections flung
by the He picked up and inspected several large semi-cylinders
of the thin white bark of a and finally chose two which seemed
to suit Then he knelt by the fire and painfully wrote something
upon each of these with his ôred one he rolled up and put in his
jacket and the other he put in JoeÆs hat and removed it to a
little distance from the And he also put into the hat certain
schoolboy treasures of almost inestimable them a lump of
an India-rubber three and one of that kind
of marbles known as a ôsure ænough crystal.ö Then he tiptoed his way
cautiously among the trees till he felt that he was out of and
straightway broke into a keen run in the direction of the




CHAPTER XV

A few minutes later Tom was in the shoal water of the wading toward
the Illinois Before the depth reached his middle he was halfway
the current would permit no more so he struck out
confidently to swim the remaining hundred He swam quartering
but still was swept downward rather faster than he had
he reached the shore and drifted along till
he found a low place and drew himself He put his hand on his jacket
found his piece of bark and then struck through the
following the with streaming Shortly before ten
oÆclock he came out into an open place opposite the and saw the
ferryboat lying in the shadow of the trees and the high Everything
was quiet under the blinking He crept down the watching
with all his slipped into the swam three or four strokes
and climbed into the skiff that did ôyawlö duty at the boatÆs He
laid himself down under the thwarts and

Presently the cracked bell tapped and a voice gave the order to ôcast
off.ö A minute or two later the skiffÆs head was standing high
against the boatÆs and the voyage was Tom felt happy in
his for he knew it was the boatÆs last trip for the At
the end of a long twelve or fifteen minutes the wheels and
Tom slipped overboard and swam ashore in the landing fifty yards
out of danger of possible

He flew along unfrequented and shortly found himself at his
auntÆs back He climbed approached the and looked
in at the sitting-room for a light was burning There
sat Aunt and Joe HarperÆs grouped
They were by the and the bed was between them and the
Tom went to the door and began to softly lift the then
he pressed gently and the door yielded a he continued pushing
and quaking every time it till he judged he might
squeeze through on his so he put his head through and


ôWhat makes the candle blow said Aunt Tom hurried
that doorÆs I of course it No end of strange
things Go ælong and shut Sid.ö

Tom disappeared under the bed just in He lay and ôbreathedö
himself for a and then crept to where he could almost touch his
auntÆs

ôBut as I was said Aunt ôhe warnÆt so to
Only just and you He warnÆt
any more responsible than a _He_ never meant any and he was
the best-hearted boy that ever she began to

ôIt was just so with my full of his and up to
every kind of but he was just as unselfish and kind as he
could laws bless to think I went and whipped him for taking

it was and I never to see him again in this
poor abused And Mrs. Harper sobbed as if her heart would


ôI hope TomÆs better off where he said ôbut if heÆd been
better in some

Tom felt the glare of the old ladyÆs though he could not
see ôNot a word against my now that heÆs GodÆll take care
of you trouble Mrs. I donÆt
know how to give him I donÆt know how to give him He was such a
comfort to although he tormented my old heart out of æmost.ö

ôThe Lord giveth and the Lord hath taken be the name of
the But itÆs so itÆs so Only last Saturday my Joe
busted a firecracker right under my nose and I knocked him
Little did I know how if it was to do over again IÆd hug
him and bless him for it.ö

I know just how you Mrs. I know just
exactly how you No longer ago than yesterday my Tom took
and filled the cat full of and I did think the cretur would
tear the house And God forgive I cracked TomÆs head with my
poor poor dead But heÆs out of all his troubles
And the last words I ever heard him say was to

But this memory was too much for the old and she broke entirely
Tom was more in pity of himself than
anybody He could hear Mary and putting in a kindly word
for him from time to He began to have a nobler opinion of himself
than ever he was sufficiently touched by his auntÆs grief
to long to rush out from under the bed and overwhelm her with
the theatrical gorgeousness of the thing appealed strongly to his
but he resisted and lay

He went on and gathered by odds and ends that it was
conjectured at first that the boys had got drowned while taking a
then the small raft had been certain boys said the missing
lads had promised that the village should ôhear somethingö the
wise-heads had ôput this and that togetherö and decided that the lads
had gone off on that raft and would turn up at the next town
but toward noon the raft had been lodged against the
Missouri shore some five or six miles below the then hope
they must be else hunger would have driven them home
by nightfall if not It was believed that the search for the
bodies had been a fruitless effort merely because the drowning must
have occurred in since the being good would
otherwise have escaped to This was Wednesday If the bodies
continued missing until all hope would be given and the
funerals would be preached on that Tom

Mrs. Harper gave a sobbing goodnight and turned to Then with a
mutual impulse the two bereaved women flung themselves into each otherÆs
arms and had a consoling and then Aunt Polly was
tender far beyond her in her goodnight to Sid and Sid
snuffled a bit and Mary went off crying with all her

Aunt Polly knelt down and prayed for Tom so so
and with such measureless love in her words and her old trembling
that he was weltering in tears long before she was

He had to keep still long after she went to for she kept making
broken-hearted ejaculations from time to tossing and
turning But at last she was only moaning a little in her
Now the boy stole rose gradually by the shaded the
candle-light with his and stood regarding His heart was full
of pity for He took out his sycamore scroll and placed it by the
But something occurred to and he lingered
His face lighted with a happy solution of his he put the bark
hastily in his Then he bent over and kissed the faded and
straightway made his stealthy latching the door behind

He threaded his way back to the ferry found nobody at large
and walked boldly on board the for he knew she was
tenantless except that there was a who always turned in and
slept like a graven He untied the skiff at the slipped
into and was soon rowing cautiously When he had pulled a
mile above the he started quartering across and bent himself
stoutly to his He hit the landing on the other side for
this was a familiar bit of work to He was moved to capture
the arguing that it might be considered a ship and therefore
legitimate prey for a but he knew a thorough search would be
made for it and that might end in So he stepped ashore and
entered the

He sat down and took a long torturing himself meanwhile to keep
and then started warily down the The night was far
It was broad daylight before he found himself fairly abreast the
island He rested again until the sun was well up and gilding the
great river with its and then he plunged into the A
little later he upon the threshold of the and
heard Joe

knows that would be a disgrace to a and TomÆs too proud for that
sort of HeÆs up to something or Now I wonder

the things is ainÆt

ôPretty but not The writing says they are if he ainÆt

ôWhich he exclaimed with fine dramatic stepping
grandly into

A sumptuous breakfast of bacon and fish was shortly and as the
boys set to work upon Tom recounted his
They were a vain and boastful company of heroes when the tale was
Then Tom hid himself away in a shady nook to sleep till and the
other pirates got ready to fish and




CHAPTER XVI

AFTER dinner all the gang turned out to hunt for turtle eggs on the
They went about poking sticks into the and when they found a soft
place they went down on their knees and dug with their Sometimes
they would take fifty or sixty eggs out of one They were perfectly
round white things a trifle smaller than an English They had a
famous fried-egg feast that and another on Friday

After breakfast they went whooping and prancing out on the and
chased each other round and shedding clothes as they until
they were and then continued the frolic far away up the shoal
water of the against the stiff which latter tripped their
legs from under them from time to time and greatly increased the
And now and then they stooped in a group and splashed water in each
otherÆs faces with their gradually approaching each with
averted faces to avoid the strangling and finally gripping and
struggling till the best man ducked his and then they all
went under in a tangle of white legs and arms and came up
and gasping for breath at one and the same

When they were well they would run out and sprawl on the
hot and lie there and cover themselves up with and by and by
break for the water again and go through the original performance once
Finally it occurred to them that their naked skin represented
flesh-colored ôtightsö very so they drew a ring in the sand and
had a three clowns in for none would yield this proudest
post to his

Next they got their marbles and played ôknucksö and ôringtawö and
ôkeepsö till that amusement grew Then Joe and Huck had another
but Tom would not because he found that in kicking off
his trousers he had kicked his string of rattlesnake rattles off his
and he wondered how he had escaped cramp so long without the
protection of this mysterious He did not venture again until he
had found and by that time the other boys were tired and ready to
They gradually wandered dropped into the and
fell to gazing longingly across the wide river to where the village lay
drowsing in the Tom found himself writing ôBECKYö in the sand with
his big he scratched it and was angry with himself for his
But he wrote it he could not help He
erased it once more and then took himself out of temptation by driving
the other boys together and joining

But JoeÆs spirits had gone down almost beyond He was so
homesick that he could hardly endure the misery of The tears lay
very near the Huck was Tom was
but tried hard not to show He had a secret which he was not ready
to but if this mutinous depression was not broken up he
would have to bring it He with a great show of

ôI bet thereÆs been pirates on this island WeÆll explore
it TheyÆve hid treasures here HowÆd you feel to light
on a rotten chest full of gold and

But it roused only faint which faded with no
Tom tried one or two other but they It was
discouraging Joe sat poking up the sand with a stick and looking
very Finally he

letÆs give it I want to go ItÆs so lonesome.ö

ôOh youÆll feel better by and said ôJust think of the
fishing thatÆs here.ö

ôI donÆt care for I want to go home.ö

there ainÆt such another swimming-place anywhere.ö

ôSwimmingÆs no I donÆt seem to care for when there
ainÆt anybody to say I shaÆnÆt go I mean to go home.ö

You want to see your I reckon.ö

I _do_ want to see my you if you had I

Huck any heart in

ôIÆll never speak to you again as long as I said

ôWho said ôNobody wants you Go ælong home and get
laughed youÆre a nice Huck and me ainÆt WeÆll
wonÆt Let him go if he wants I reckon we can get
along without perÆaps.ö

But Tom was and was alarmed to see Joe go sullenly
on with his And then it was discomforting to see Huck eying
JoeÆs preparations so and keeping up such an ominous
without a parting Joe began to wade off toward the
Illinois TomÆs heart began to He glanced at Huck
could not bear the and dropped his Then he

ôI want to It was getting so lonesome and now
itÆll be LetÆs us Tom.ö

ôI You can all if you want I mean to stay.ö

I better go.ö

go hendering you.ö

Huck began to pick up his scattered He

I wisht youÆd Now you think it WeÆll wait for you
when we get to shore.ö

youÆll wait a blame long thatÆs all.ö

Huck started sorrowfully and Tom stood looking after with a
strong desire tugging at his heart to yield his pride and go along
He hoped the boys would but they still waded slowly It
suddenly dawned on Tom that it was become very lonely and He made
one final struggle with his and then darted after his


I want to tell you

They presently stopped and turned When he got to where they
he began unfolding his and they listened moodily till
at last they saw the ôpointö he was driving and then they set up a
warwhoop of applause and said it was and said if he had
told them at they wouldnÆt have started He made a plausible
but his real reason had been the fear that not even the secret
would keep them with him any very great length of and so he had
meant to hold it in reserve as a last

The lads came gayly back and went at their sports again with a
chattering all the time about TomÆs stupendous plan and admiring the
genius of After a dainty egg and fish Tom said he wanted to
learn to Joe caught at the idea and said he would like to
So Huck made pipes and filled These novices had never

I reckon IÆll just _bet_ they

So the talk ran But presently it began to flag a and
grow The silences the expectoration marvellously
Every pore inside the boysÆ cheeks became a spouting
they could scarcely bail out the cellars under their tongues
fast enough to prevent an little overflowings down their
throats occurred in spite of all they could and sudden retchings
followed every Both boys were looking very pale and
JoeÆs pipe dropped from his nerveless TomÆs Both
fountains were going furiously and both pumps bailing with might and
Joe said

ôIÆve lost my I reckon I better go and find it.ö

Tom with quivering lips and halting

ôIÆll help You go over that way and IÆll hunt around by the

So Huck sat down and waited an Then he found it
and went to find his They were wide apart in the both
very both fast But something informed him that if they had
had any trouble they had got rid of

They were not talkative at supper that They had a humble

About midnight Joe and called the There was a brooding
oppressiveness in the air that seemed to bode The boys
huddled themselves together and sought the friendly companionship of

Beyond the light of the fire everything was swallowed up in the

vaguely revealed the foliage for a moment and then By and by

breath upon their and shuddered with the fancy that the Spirit

sweep of chilly air passed rustling all the leaves and snowing the

booming thunderblasts drowned their voices one by one

to be grateful They could not the old sail flapped so
even if the other noises would have allowed The tempest
rose higher and and presently the sail tore loose from its
fastenings and went winging away on the The boys seized each

of a great oak that stood upon the Now the battle was at its

driving spray of the dim outlines of the high bluffs on

and unspeakably The storm culminated in one matchless effort
that seemed likely to tear the island to burn it drown it to

But at last the battle was and the forces retired with weaker and
weaker threatenings and and peace resumed her The
boys went back to a good deal but they found there was still
something to be thankful because the great the shelter
of their was a blasted by the and they were
not under it when the catastrophe

Everything in camp was the campfire as for they were but
heedless like their and had made no provision against
Here was matter for for they were soaked through and
They were eloquent in their but they presently
discovered that the fire had eaten so far up under the great log it had

patiently wrought with shreds and bark gathered from the under

piled on great dead boughs till they had a roaring and were

As the sun began to steal in upon the drowsiness came over

CHAPTER XVII

BUT there was no hilarity in the little town that same tranquil Saturday
The and Aunt PollyÆs were being put into
with great grief and many An unusual quiet possessed
the although it was ordinarily quiet in all
The villagers conducted their concerns with an absent and talked
but they sighed The Saturday holiday seemed a burden to
the They had no heart in their and gradually gave them


In the afternoon Becky Thatcher found herself moping about the deserted
schoolhouse and feeling very But she found nothing
there to comfort She

anything now to remember him by.ö And she choked back a little

Presently she and said to

ôIt was right if it was to do over I wouldnÆt say
wouldnÆt say it for the whole But heÆs gone IÆll
never see him any more.ö

This thought broke her and she wandered with tears rolling
down her Then quite a group of boys and of TomÆs
and and stood looking over the paling fence and talking
in reverent tones of how Tom did so-and-so the last time they saw
and how Joe said this and that small trifle with awful
as they could easily see each speaker pointed out
the exact spot where the lost lads stood at the and then added
something like ôand I was a-standing just as I am and as if
you was was as close as he just this then
something seemed to go all over you I never
thought what it of but I can see

Then there was a dispute about who saw the dead boys last in and
many claimed that dismal and offered more or
less tampered with by the and when it was ultimately decided
who _did_ see the departed and exchanged the last words with
the lucky parties took upon themselves a sort of sacred
and were gaped at and envied by all the One poor who had
no other grandeur to said with tolerably manifest pride in the


Tom Sawyer he licked me once.ö

But that bid for glory was a Most of the boys could say
and so that cheapened the distinction too The group loitered
still recalling memories of the lost in awed

When the Sunday-school hour was the next the bell
began to instead of ringing in the usual It was a very still
and the mournful sound seemed in keeping with the musing hush
that lay upon The villagers began to loitering a moment
in the vestibule to converse in whispers about the sad But there
was no whispering in the only the funereal rustling of dresses
as the women gathered to their seats disturbed the silence None
could remember when the little church had been so full There
was finally a waiting an expectant and then Aunt Polly
followed by Sid and and they by the Harper all in
deep and the whole the old minister as rose
reverently and stood until the mourners were seated in the front
There was another communing broken at intervals by muffled
and then the minister spread his hands abroad and A moving
hymn was and the text ôI am the Resurrection and the
Life.ö

As the service the clergyman drew such pictures of the
the winning and the rare promise of the lost lads that
every soul thinking he recognized these felt a pang
in remembering that he had persistently blinded himself to them always
and had as persistently seen only faults and flaws in the poor
The minister related many a touching incident in the lives of the
which illustrated their generous and the
people could easily how noble and beautiful those episodes
and remembered with grief that at the time they occurred they had
seemed rank well deserving of the The congregation
became more and more as the pathetic tale went till at last
the whole company broke down and joined the weeping mourners in a chorus
of anguished the preacher himself giving way to his and
crying in the

There was a rustle in the which nobody a moment later
the church door the minister raised his streaming eyes above
his and stood First one and then another pair
of eyes followed the and then almost with one impulse the
congregation rose and stared while the three dead boys came marching up
the Tom in the Joe and a ruin of drooping
sneaking sheepishly in the They had been hid in the unused gallery
listening to their own funeral

Aunt and the Harpers threw themselves upon their restored

poor Huck stood abashed and not knowing exactly what
to do or where to hide from so many unwelcoming He and
started to slink but Tom seized him and

ôAunt it ainÆt SomebodyÆs got to be glad to see Huck.ö

ôAnd so they IÆm glad to see poor motherless And
the loving attentions Aunt Polly lavished upon him were the one thing
capable of making him more uncomfortable than he was

Suddenly the minister shouted at the top of his ôPraise God from
whom all blessings put your hearts in

And they Old Hundred swelled up with a triumphant and
while it shook the rafters Tom Sawyer the Pirate looked around upon the
envying juveniles about him and confessed in his heart that this was the
proudest moment of his

As the ôsoldö congregation trooped out they said they would almost be
willing to be made ridiculous again to hear Old Hundred sung like that
once

Tom got more cuffs and kisses that to Aunt PollyÆs varying
he had earned before in a and he hardly knew which
expressed the most gratefulness to God and affection for




CHAPTER XVIII

THAT was TomÆs great scheme to return home with his brother

Missouri shore on a at dusk on landing five or six miles
below the they had slept in the woods at the edge of the town
till nearly and had then crept through back lanes and alleys
and finished their sleep in the gallery of the church among a chaos of

The children left for and the old lady to call on Mrs. Harper
and vanquish her realism with TomÆs marvellous Sid had better
judgment than to utter the thought that was in his mind as he left the
It was ôPretty long a dream as without any
mistakes in

What a hero Tom was He did not go skipping and
but moved with a dignified swagger as became a pirate who felt that the
public eye was on And indeed it he tried not to seem to see
the looks or hear the remarks as he passed but they were food and
drink to Smaller boys than himself flocked at his as proud
to be seen with and tolerated by as if he had been the drummer
at the head of a procession or the elephant leading a menagerie into
Boys of his own size pretended not to know he had been away at
but they were consuming with They would have
given anything to have that swarthy sun-tanned skin of and his
glittering and Tom would not have parted with either for a


At school the children made so much of him and of and delivered
such eloquent admiration from their that the two heroes were
not long in becoming insufferably ôstuck-up.ö They began to tell their
adventures to hungry they only it was not a
thing likely to have an with imaginations like theirs to furnish

puffing the very summit of glory was

Tom decided that he could be independent of Becky Thatcher Glory

maybe she would be wanting to ômake up.ö let should see
that he could be as indifferent as some other Presently she
Tom pretended not to see He moved away and joined a group
of boys and girls and began to Soon he observed that she was
tripping gayly back and forth with flushed face and dancing
pretending to be busy chasing and screaming with laughter
when she made a but he noticed that she always made her
captures in his and that she seemed to cast a conscious eye
in his direction at such It gratified all the vicious vanity
that was in and instead of winning it only ôset him upö
the more and made him the more diligent to avoid betraying that he
knew she was Presently she gave over and moved
irresolutely sighing once or twice and glancing furtively and
wistfully toward Then she observed that now Tom was talking more
particularly to Amy Lawrence than to any one She felt a sharp pang
and grew disturbed and uneasy at She tried to go but her
feet were and carried her to the group She said to
a girl almost at TomÆs sham

Mary you bad why didnÆt you come to

ôI did you see

Did Where did you

ôI was in Miss PetersÆ where I always I saw _you_.ö

ôDid itÆs funny I didnÆt see I wanted to tell you about

ôThatÆs ever so When is it going to

every one thatÆs friends to wants to and she glanced
ever so furtively at but he talked right along to Amy Lawrence
about the terrible storm on the and how the lightning tore the
great sycamore tree ôall to flindersö while he was ôstanding within
three feet of it.ö

may I said Grace

ôYes.ö

ôAnd said Sally

ôYes.ö

ôAnd said Susy ôAnd

ôYes.ö

And so with clapping of joyful hands till all the group had begged
for invitations but Tom and Then Tom turned coolly still
and took Amy with BeckyÆs lips trembled and the tears
came to her she hid these signs with a forced gayety and went on
but the life had gone out of the and out of
everything she got away as soon as she could and hid herself and
had what her sex call ôa good cry.ö Then she sat with wounded
till the bell She roused with a vindictive cast
in her and gave her plaited tails a shake and said she knew what
_sheÆd_

At recess Tom continued his flirtation with Amy with jubilant
And he kept drifting about to find Becky and lacerate
her with the At last he spied but there was a sudden
falling of his She was sitting cosily on a little bench behind
the schoolhouse looking at a picture-book with Alfred so
absorbed were and their heads so close together over the
that they did not seem to be conscious of anything in the world
Jealousy ran red-hot through TomÆs He began to hate himself for
throwing away the chance Becky had offered for a He
called himself a and all the hard names he could think He
wanted to cry with Amy chatted happily as they
for her heart was but TomÆs tongue had lost its He
did not hear what Amy was and whenever she paused expectantly
he could only stammer an awkward which was as often misplaced
as He kept drifting to the rear of the again and
to sear his eyeballs with the hateful spectacle He could
not help And it maddened him to as he thought he that
Becky Thatcher never once suspected that he was even in the land of the
But she did and she knew she was winning her
and was glad to see him suffer as she had

AmyÆs happy prattle became Tom hinted at things he had
to attend things that must be and time was But in
girl chirped Tom hang ainÆt I ever going
to get rid of At last he must be attending to those she
said artlessly that she would be ôaroundö when school let And he
hastened hating her for

ôAny other Tom grating his ôAny boy in the whole
town but that Saint Louis smarty that thinks he dresses so fine and is
all I licked you the first day you ever saw this
and IÆll lick you You just wait till I catch you
IÆll just take

And he went through the motions of thrashing an imaginary
the and kicking and you do You holler
do let that learn And so the imaginary
flogging was finished to his

Tom fled home at His conscience could not endure any more of AmyÆs
grateful and his jealousy could bear no more of the other
Becky resumed her picture inspections with but as the
minutes dragged along and no Tom came to her triumph began to
cloud and she lost gravity and absentmindedness
and then two or three times she pricked up her ear at
a but it was a false no Tom At last she grew
entirely miserable and wished she hadnÆt carried it so When
poor seeing that he was losing he did not know kept
hereÆs a jolly look at she lost patience at

into and got up and walked

Alfred dropped alongside and was going to try to comfort but she


ôGo away and leave me canÆt I hate

So the boy wondering what he could have she had said
she would look at pictures all through the she walked
Then Alfred went musing into the deserted He was
humiliated and He easily guessed his way to the girl

He was far from hating Tom the less when this thought occurred to

poured ink upon the

intending to find Tom and tell Tom would be thankful and their
troubles would be Before she was half way she
had changed her The thought of TomÆs treatment of her when she was
talking about her picnic came scorching back and filled her with
She resolved to let him get whipped on the damaged spelling-bookÆs

CHAPTER XIX

TOM arrived at home in a dreary and the first thing his aunt said
to him showed him that he had brought his sorrows to an unpromising


IÆve a notion to skin you

what have I

youÆve done Here I go over to Sereny like an old
expecting IÆm going to make her believe all that rubbage about
that when lo and behold you sheÆd found out from Joe that you was
over here and heard all the talk we had that I donÆt know
what is to become of a boy that will act like It makes me feel so
bad to think you could let me go to Sereny Harper and make such a fool
of myself and never say a word.ö

This was a new aspect of the His smartness of the morning had
seemed to Tom a good joke and very It merely looked
mean and shabby He hung his head and could not think of anything to
say for a Then he

I wish I hadnÆt done I didnÆt think.ö

you never You never think of anything but your
own You could think to come all the way over here from
JacksonÆs Island in the night to laugh at our and you could
think to fool me with a lie about a but you couldnÆt ever think
to pity us and save us from sorrow.ö

I know now it was but I didnÆt mean to be I
And I didnÆt come over here to laugh at you that
night.ö

ôWhat did you come

ôIt was to tell you not to be uneasy about because we hadnÆt got
drownded.ö

I would be the thankfullest soul in this world if I could
believe you ever had as good a thought as but you know you never
I know Tom.ö

ôIndeed and ædeed I wish I may never stir if I didnÆt.ö

donÆt do It only makes things a hundred times
worse.ö

ôIt ainÆt a itÆs the I wanted to keep you from
was all that made me come.ö

ôIÆd give the whole world to believe would cover up a power
of IÆd æmost be glad youÆd run off and acted so But it
ainÆt why didnÆt you tell

you when you got to talking about the I just got all
full of the idea of our coming and hiding in the and I couldnÆt
somehow bear to spoil So I just put the bark back in my pocket and
kept mum.ö

ôWhat

ôThe bark I had wrote on to tell you weÆd gone I
youÆd waked up when I kissed honest.ö

The hard lines in his auntÆs face relaxed and a sudden tenderness dawned
in her

ô_Did_ you kiss

I did.ö

ôAre you sure you

I sure.ö

ôWhat did you kiss me

ôBecause I loved you and you laid there moaning and I was so sorry.ö

The words sounded like The old lady could not hide a tremor in
her voice when she

ôKiss me be off with you to and donÆt
bother me any more.ö

The moment he was she ran to a closet and got out the ruin of a
jacket which Tom had gone pirating Then she with it in her
and said to

I donÆt Poor I reckon heÆs lied about itÆs a
blessed thereÆs such a comfort come from I hope
the _know_ the Lord will forgive because it was such
good-heartedness in him to tell But I donÆt want to find out itÆs a
I wonÆt look.ö

She put the jacket and stood by musing a Twice she put out
her hand to take the garment and twice she Once more
she and this time she fortified herself with the
ôItÆs a good a good wonÆt let it grieve me.ö So she
sought the jacket A moment later she was reading TomÆs piece of
bark through flowing tears and ôI could forgive the if
heÆd committed a million




CHAPTER XX

THERE was something about Aunt PollyÆs when she kissed that
swept away his low spirits and made him lighthearted and happy He
started to school and had the luck of coming upon Becky Thatcher at the
head of Meadow His mood always determined his Without a
momentÆs hesitation he ran to her and

ôI acted mighty mean and IÆm so I wonÆt ever
do that way as long as ever I make wonÆt

The girl stopped and looked him scornfully in the

ôIÆll thank you to keep yourself _to_ Mr. Thomas IÆll
never speak to you again.ö

She tossed her head and passed Tom was so stunned that he had not
even presence of mind enough to say ôWho Miss until the
right time to say it had gone So he said But he was in a
fine He moped into the schoolyard wishing she were
a and imagining how he would trounce her if she He presently
encountered her and delivered a stinging remark as he She hurled
one in and the angry breach was It seemed to in
her hot that she could hardly wait for school to ôtake
she was so impatient to see Tom flogged for the injured
If she had had any lingering notion of exposing Alfred TomÆs
offensive fling had driven it entirely

Poor she did not know how fast she was nearing trouble
The Mr. had reached middle age with an unsatisfied
The darling of his desires to be a but
poverty had decreed that he should be nothing higher than a village
Every day he took a mysterious book out of his desk and
absorbed himself in it at times when no classes were He kept
that book under lock and There was not an urchin in school but was
perishing to have a glimpse of but the chance never Every boy
and girl had a theory about the nature of that but no two theories
were and there was no way of getting at the facts in the
as Becky was passing by the which stood near the she
noticed that the key was in the It was a precious She
glanced found herself and the next instant she had the
book in her The SomebodyÆs
no information to her so she began to turn the She came at
once upon a handsomely engraved and colored human
stark At that moment a shadow fell on the page and Tom Sawyer
stepped in at the door and caught a glimpse of the Becky
snatched at the book to close and had the hard luck to tear the
pictured page half down the She thrust the volume into the
turned the and burst out crying with shame and

ôTom you are just as mean as you can to sneak up on a person
and look at what theyÆre looking at.ö

ôHow could I know you was looking at

ôYou ought to be ashamed of Tom you know youÆre
going to tell on and what shall I what shall I IÆll be
and I never was whipped in school.ö

Then she stamped her little foot and

ô_Be_ so mean if you want I know something thatÆs going to
You just wait and youÆll she flung
out of the house with a new explosion of

Tom stood rather flustered by this Presently he said
to

ôWhat a curious kind of a fool a girl Never been licked in
WhatÆs a ThatÆs just like a so
thin-skinned and of course I ainÆt going to tell
old Dobbins on this little because thereÆs other ways of getting
even on that ainÆt so but what of Old Dobbins will ask
who it was tore his NobodyÆll Then heÆll do just the way
he always first one and then and when he comes to the
right girl heÆll know without any GirlsÆ faces always tell
on They ainÆt got any SheÆll get itÆs a
kind of a tight place for Becky because there ainÆt any way

made to squirm it into some aspect or other that the moral and religious

be sufficient while the world There is no school in

hill tÆother side of Still-House

So they got a crippled pick and a and set out on their
three-mile They arrived hot and and threw themselves
down in the shade of a neighboring elm to rest and have a

ôItÆs all the I some says some says

ôAll Only if you get married IÆll be more lonesomer

ôNo you YouÆll come and live with Now stir out of this and
weÆll go to digging.ö

They worked and sweated for half an No They toiled another
Still no Huck

ôDo they always bury it as deep as

Not I reckon we havenÆt got the right
place.ö

So they chose a new spot and began The labor dragged a
but still they made They pegged away in silence for some
Finally Huck leaned on his swabbed the beaded drops from his
brow with his and

ôWhere you going to dig after we get this

ôI reckon maybe weÆll tackle the old tree thatÆs over yonder on Cardiff
Hill back of the widowÆs.ö

ôI reckon thatÆll be a good But wonÆt the widow take it away from
ItÆs on her land.ö

ô_She_ take it Maybe sheÆd like to try it Whoever finds one

That was The work went By and by Huck

ôBlame we must be in the wrong place What do you

ôIt is mighty I donÆt understand Sometimes witches
I reckon maybe thatÆs whatÆs the trouble now.ö

Witches ainÆt got no power in the daytime.ö

these holes theyÆll know in a minute whatÆs here and theyÆll go for it.ö

IÆll come around and maow tonight.ö

ôAll LetÆs hide the tools in the bushes.ö

The boys were there that about the appointed They sat in
the shadow It was a lonely and an hour made solemn by
old Spirits whispered in the rustling ghosts lurked
in the murky the deep baying of a hound floated up out of the
an owl answered with his sepulchral The boys were
subdued by these and talked By and by they judged
that twelve had they marked where the shadow and began to
Their hopes commenced to Their interest grew and
their industry kept pace with The hole deepened and still
but every time their hearts jumped to hear the pick strike upon
they only suffered a new It was only a stone
or a At last Tom

ôIt ainÆt any weÆre wrong again.ö

but we _canÆt_ be We spotted the shadder to a dot.ö

ôI know but then thereÆs another thing.ö

ôWhatÆs

we only guessed at the Like enough it was too late or too
early.ö

Huck dropped his

ôThatÆs said ôThatÆs the very We got to give this one
We canÆt ever tell the right and besides this kind of thingÆs

around I feel as if somethingÆs behind me all the áand IÆm
afeard to turn becuz maybe thereÆs others in front a-waiting for

IÆve been pretty much They most always put in a

they IÆve always heard that.ö

I donÆt like to fool around much where thereÆs dead A
bodyÆs bound to get into trouble with sure.ö

ôI donÆt like to stir æem SÆpose this one here was to stick
his skull out and say

ôDonÆt ItÆs awful.ö

it just I donÆt feel comfortable a bit.ö

letÆs give this place and try somewheres else.ö

ôAll I reckon we better.ö

ôWhatÆll it

Tom considered and then

ôThe haÆnted ThatÆs

ôBlame I donÆt like haÆnted theyÆre a dern sight
worseÆn dead Dead people might but they donÆt come
sliding around in a when you ainÆt and peep over your
shoulder all of a sudden and grit their the way a ghost I
couldnÆt stand such a thing as could.ö

ghosts donÆt travel around only at They wonÆt
hender us from digging there in the daytime.ö

thatÆs But you know mighty well people donÆt go about that
haÆnted house in the day nor the night.ö

thatÆs mostly because they donÆt like to go where a manÆs been
nothingÆs ever been seen around that house except
in the some blue lights slipping by the regular
ghosts.ö

where you see one of them blue lights flickering
you can bet thereÆs a ghost mighty close behind It stands to
Becuz you know that they donÆt anybody but ghosts use æem.ö

thatÆs But anyway they donÆt come around in the so
whatÆs the use of our being

all WeÆll tackle the haÆnted house if you say I
reckon itÆs taking chances.ö

They had started down the hill by this There in the middle of the
moonlit valley below them stood the ôhaÆntedö utterly
its fences gone long rank weeds smothering the very the
chimney crumbled to the window-sashes a corner of the roof
caved The boys gazed half expecting to see a blue light flit
past a then talking in a low as befitted the time and the
they struck far off to the to give the haunted
house a wide and took their way homeward through the woods that
adorned the rearward side of Cardiff




CHAPTER XVI

ABOUT noon the next day the boys arrived at the dead they had come
for their Tom was impatient to go to the haunted Huck was
measurably suddenly

do you know what day it

Tom mentally ran over the days of the and then quickly lifted his
eyes with a startled look in

I never once thought of

I didnÆt but all at once it popped onto me that it was
Friday.ö

ôBlame a body canÆt be too We might æaÆ got into an
awful tackling such a thing on a Friday.ö

Better say we ThereÆs some lucky but
Friday ainÆt.ö

ôAny fool knows I donÆt reckon _you_ was the first that found it
Huck.ö

I never said I did And Friday ainÆt I had a
rotten bad dream last about rats.ö

Sure sign of Did they

ôNo.ö

thatÆs When they donÆt fight itÆs only a sign that
thereÆs trouble you All we got to do is to look mighty
sharp and keep out of WeÆll drop this thing for and Do
you know Robin

WhoÆs Robin

he was one of the greatest men that was ever in the
He was a robber.ö

I wisht I Who did he

ôOnly sheriffs and bishops and rich people and and such But
he never bothered the He loved He always divided up with æem
perfectly square.ö

he must æaÆ been a brick.ö

ôI bet you he he was the noblest man that ever
They ainÆt any such men I can tell He could lick any man in
with one hand tied behind and he could take his yew bow
and plug a ten-cent piece every a mile and a half.ö

ôWhatÆs a _yew_

ôI donÆt ItÆs some kind of a of And if he hit that
dime only on the edge he would set down and But weÆll
play Robin nobby IÆll learn you.ö

ôIÆm agreed.ö

So they played Robin Hood all the now and then casting a
yearning eye down upon the haunted house and passing a remark about the
morrowÆs prospects and possibilities As the sun began to sink
into the west they took their way homeward athwart the long shadows
of the trees and soon were buried from sight in the forests of Cardiff


On shortly after the boys were at the dead tree
They had a smoke and a chat in the and then dug a little in their
last not with great but merely because Tom said there were
so many cases where people had given up a treasure after getting down
within six inches of and then somebody else had come along and
turned it up with a single thrust of a The thing failed this
so the boys shouldered their tools and went away feeling
that they had not trifled with but had fulfilled all the
requirements that belong to the business of

When they reached the haunted house there was something so weird and
grisly about the dead silence that reigned there under the baking
and something so depressing about the loneliness and desolation of the
that they were for a to venture Then they
crept to the door and took a trembling They saw a
floorless an ancient vacant
a ruinous and and everywhere hung ragged and
abandoned They presently with quickened
talking in ears alert to catch the slightest
and muscles tense and ready for instant

In a little while familiarity modified their fears and they gave the
place a critical and interested rather admiring their own
and wondering at Next they wanted to look
This was something like cutting off but they got to daring

tools into a corner and made the Up there were the same signs of

promise was a was nothing in Their courage was up now
and well in They were about to go down and begin work

ôWhat is whispered blanching with

ôKeep DonÆt you TheyÆre coming right toward the door.ö

The boys stretched themselves upon the floor with their eyes to
knotholes in the and lay in a misery of

Two men Each boy said to ôThereÆs the old deaf and
dumb Spaniard thatÆs been about town once or twice saw

grunted the ôdeaf and dumbö the vast surprise

This voice made the boys gasp and It was Injun There was
silence for some Then Joe

ôWhatÆs any more dangerous than that job up nothingÆs come of
it.ö

ôThatÆs Away up the river and not another house

whatÆs more dangerous than coming here in the

ôI know But there warnÆt any other place as handy after that fool
of a I want to quit this I wanted to only it
warnÆt any use trying to stir out of with those infernal boys
playing over there on the hill right in full view.ö

ôThose infernal boysö quaked again under the inspiration of this
and thought how lucky it was that they had remembered it was Friday and
concluded to wait a They wished in their hearts they had waited a


The two men got out some food and made a After a long and
thoughtful Injun Joe

ôLook go back up the river where you Wait there

This was Both men presently fell to and Injun Joe


ôIÆm dead for ItÆs your turn to watch.ö

He curled down in the weeds and soon began to His comrade stirred
him once or twice and he became Presently the watcher began to

started But the first step he made wrung such a hideous creak
from the crazy floor that he sank down almost dead with He never
made a second The boys lay there counting the dragging moments
till it seemed to them that time must be done and eternity growing
and then they were grateful to note that at last the sun was

Joe grumbled then he agreed with his friend that what daylight

Tom and Huck rose weak but vastly and stared after them

were content to reach ground again without broken and take the

misfortune to find that money turn up bitter luck that

They resolved to keep a lookout for that Spaniard when he should come to
town spying out for chances to do his revengeful and follow him to

They talked it all and as they entered town they agreed to believe

CHAPTER XXVII

THE adventure of the day mightily tormented TomÆs dreams that
Four times he had his hands on that rich treasure and four times
it wasted to nothingness in his fingers as sleep forsook him and
wakefulness brought back the hard reality of his As he lay
in the early morning recalling the incidents of his great he
noticed that they seemed curiously subdued and far as if
they had happened in another or in a time long gone Then it
occurred to him that the great adventure itself must be a There
was one very strong argument in favor of this that the
quantity of coin he had seen was too vast to be He had never seen
as much as fifty dollars in one mass and he was like all boys of
his age and station in in that he imagined that all references to
ôhundredsö and ôthousandsö were mere fanciful forms of and that
no such sums really existed in the He never had supposed for
a moment that so large a sum as a hundred dollars was to be found in
actual money in any oneÆs If his notions of hidden treasure
had been they would have been found to consist of a handful of
real dimes and a bushel of ungraspable

But the incidents of his adventure grew sensibly sharper and clearer
under the attrition of thinking them and so he presently found
himself leaning to the impression that the thing might not have been a
after This uncertainty must be swept He would snatch a
hurried breakfast and go and find Huck was sitting on the gunwale
of a listlessly dangling his feet in the water and looking

he did not do then the adventure would be proved to have been only a

CHAPTER XXVIII

THAT night Tom and Huck were ready for their They hung about
the neighborhood of the tavern until after one watching the alley
at a distance and the other the tavern Nobody entered the alley or
left nobody resembling the Spaniard entered or left the tavern
The night promised to be a fair so Tom went home with the
understanding that if a considerable degree of darkness came Huck
was to come and whereupon he would slip out and try the
But the night remained and Huck closed his watch and retired to
bed in an empty sugar hogshead about

Tuesday the boys had the same ill Also But Thursday
night promised Tom slipped out in good season with his auntÆs
old tin and a large towel to blindfold it He hid the
lantern in HuckÆs sugar hogshead and the watch An hour before
midnight the tavern closed up and its lights only ones
were put No Spaniard had been Nobody had entered or left the
Everything was The blackness of darkness
the perfect stillness was interrupted only by occasional mutterings of

a season of waiting anxiety that weighed upon HuckÆs spirits like a

It seemed hours since Tom had Surely he must have
maybe he was maybe his heart had burst under terror and
In his uneasiness Huck found himself drawing closer
and closer to the fearing all sorts of dreadful and
momentarily expecting some catastrophe to happen that would take away
his There was not much to take for he seemed only able to
inhale it by and his heart would soon wear itself the
way it was Suddenly there was a flash of light and Tom came

forty miles an hour before the repetition was The boys never
stopped till they reached the shed of a deserted slaughter-house at the
lower end of the Just as they got within its shelter the storm

CHAPTER XXIX

THE first thing Tom heard on Friday morning was a glad piece of
ThatcherÆs family had come back to town the night
Both Injun Joe and the treasure sunk into secondary importance for a
and Becky took the chief place in the boyÆs He saw her
and they had an exhausting good time playing ôhispyö and ôgully-keeperö
with a crowd of their The day was completed and crowned in
a peculiarly satisfactory Becky teased her mother to appoint
the next day for the long-promised and long-delayed and she
The childÆs delight was and TomÆs not more
The invitations were sent out before and straightway
the young folks of the village were thrown into a fever of preparation
and pleasurable TomÆs excitement enabled him to keep
awake until a pretty late and he had good hopes of hearing HuckÆs
and of having his treasure to astonish Becky and the picnickers
next but he was No signal came that

Morning and by ten or eleven oÆclock a giddy and
rollicking company were gathered at Judge and everything was
ready for a It was not the custom for elderly people to mar the
picnics with their The children were considered safe enough
under the wings of a few young ladies of eighteen and a few young
gentlemen of twenty-three or The old steam ferry-boat was
chartered for the presently the gay throng filed up the main
street laden with Sid was sick and had to miss
the Mary remained at home to entertain The last thing Mrs.
Thatcher said to

ôYouÆll not get back till Perhaps youÆd better stay all night with
some of the girls that live near the child.ö

ôThen IÆll stay with Susy mamma.ö

ôVery And mind and behave yourself and donÆt be any trouble.ö

as they tripped Tom said to

tell you what weÆll æStead of going to Joe HarperÆs weÆll
climb right up the hill and stop at the Widow SheÆll have
She has it most every loads of And sheÆll be
awful glad to have us.ö

that will be

Then Becky reflected a moment and

ôBut what will mamma

ôHowÆll she ever

The girl turned the idea over in her and said

ôI reckon itÆs

ôBut Your mother wonÆt and so whatÆs the All she
wants is that youÆll be and I bet you sheÆd æaÆ said go there if
sheÆd æaÆ thought of I know she

The Widow DouglasÆ splendid hospitality was a tempting It and
TomÆs persuasions presently carried the So it was decided to say
nothing to anybody about the nightÆs Presently it occurred to
Tom that maybe Huck might come this very night and give the The
thought took a deal of the spirit out of his Still he
could not bear to give up the fun at Widow And why should he
give it he signal did not come the night so
why should it be any more likely to come The sure fun of the
evening outweighed the uncertain he determined
to yield to the stronger inclination and not allow himself to think of
the box of money another time that

Three miles below town the ferryboat stopped at the mouth of a woody
hollow and tied The crowd swarmed ashore and soon the forest
distances and craggy heights echoed far and near with shoutings and
All the different ways of getting hot and tired were gone
through and by-and-by the rovers straggled back to camp fortified
with responsible and then the destruction of the good things
After the feast there was a refreshing season of rest and chat in
the shade of spreading By-and-by somebody

CHAPTER XXX

AS the earliest suspicion of dawn appeared on Sunday Huck came
groping up the hill and rapped gently at the old WelshmanÆs The
inmates were but it was a sleep that was set on a
on account of the exciting episode of the A call came from a


ôWhoÆs

HuckÆs scared voice answered in a low

ôPlease let me ItÆs only Huck

These were strange words to the vagabond boyÆs and the pleasantest
he had ever He could not recollect that the closing word had ever
been applied in his case The door was quickly and he
Huck was given a seat and the old man and his brace of tall
sons speedily dressed

sprang up and

ôOh Please donÆt

Huck would not further than to say that he already knew too
much about one of those men and would not have the man know that he knew
anything against him for the whole would be killed for knowing


The old man promised secrecy once and

The _deaf and dumb_ man said all

Huck had made another terrible He was trying his best to keep
the old man from getting the faintest hint of who the Spaniard might

all he could He made several efforts to creep out of his
but the old manÆs eye was upon him and he made blunder after
Presently the Welshman

Huck looked into the old manÆs honest eyes a then bent over and
whispered in his

The Welshman almost jumped out of his In a moment he

ôItÆs all plain When you talked about notching ears and
slitting noses I judged that that was your own because
white men donÆt take that sort of But an ThatÆs a
different matter altogether.ö

During breakfast the talk went and in the course of it the old man
said that the last thing which he and his sons had before going
to was to get a lantern and examine the stile and its vicinity for
marks of They found but captured a bulky bundle

Poor Huck was too distressed to but the old man laughed loud and
shook up the details of his anatomy from head to and
ended by saying that such a laugh was money in a-manÆs because
it cut down the doctorÆs bill like Then he

Huck was irritated to think he had been such a goose and betrayed such
a suspicious for he had dropped the idea that the parcel
brought from the tavern was the as soon as he had heard the
talk at the widowÆs He had only thought it was not the
had not known that it so the suggestion of a
captured bundle was too much for his But on the whole
he felt glad the little episode had for now he knew beyond all

at rest and exceedingly In everything seemed to be

Tom could seize the gold that night without any trouble or any fear of

beholden to than you are to me and my but he donÆt allow me
to tell his We wouldnÆt have been there but for him.ö

Of course this excited a curiosity so vast that it almost belittled the

refused to part with his When all else had been the

More visitors and the story had to be told and retold for a couple
of hours

There was no Sabbath-school during day-school but everybody
was early at The stirring event was well News came
that not a sign of the two villains had been yet When the

told how he went back for Becky and broke the good news and she told
him not to fret her with such for she was and knew she was

When the cave door was a sorrowful sight presented itself in
the dim twilight of the Injun Joe lay stretched upon the
with his face close to the crack of the as if his longing
eyes had been to the latest upon the light and the cheer

experience how this wretch had His pity was but
nevertheless he felt an abounding sense of relief and
which revealed to him in a degree which he had not fully appreciated
before how vast a weight of dread had been lying upon him since the day
he lifted his voice against this bloody-minded

Injun JoeÆs bowie-knife lay close its blade broken in The great
foundation-beam of the door had been chipped and hacked with
tedious useless it for the native rock formed a
sill outside and upon that stubborn material the knife had wrought

had been no stony obstruction there the labor would have been useless
for if the beam had been wholly cut away Injun Joe could not have
squeezed his body under the and he knew So he had only hacked
that place in order to be doing order to pass the weary

find half a dozen bits of candle stuck around in the crevices of this

British when Columbus when the massacre at Lexington was

Injun Joe was buried near the mouth of the and people flocked
there in boats and wagons from the towns and from all the farms and
hamlets for seven miles they brought their and
all sorts of and confessed that they had had almost as
satisfactory a time at the funeral as they could have had at the


This funeral stopped the further growth of one petition to the
governor for Injun JoeÆs The petition had been largely
many tearful and eloquent meetings had been and a committee of
sappy women been appointed to go in deep mourning and wail around the

have been plenty of weaklings ready to scribble their names to a

The morning after the funeral Tom took Huck to a private place to have
an important Huck had learned all about TomÆs adventure from the
Welshman and the Widow by this but Tom said he reckoned
there was one thing they had not told that thing was what he wanted
to talk about HuckÆs face He

ôI know what it You got into 2 and never found anything but
Nobody told me it was but I just knowed it must æaÆ ben
soon as I heard æbout that whiskey and I knowed you
hadnÆt got the money becuz youÆd æaÆ got at me some way or other and

ô_You_ followed

I donÆt want æem souring on me and doing me mean If it hadnÆt

Then Huck told his entire adventure in confidence to who had only
heard of the WelshmanÆs part of it

said coming back to the main ôwhoever

A trifle after noon the boys borrowed a small skiff from a citizen who
